Automated MachineLearning program that would perform an image classification between the user requested classes

For the correct functioning of this project there is an order of execution of the different files: 

  1. First you should execute CargaFlickr.py which will help you download the required datasets for the classification.
  2. After that you should use the DataA.py file which will perform Data Augmentation techniques over the datasets, as a result we will obtain bigger datasets which will help to make our model perform better.
  3. Lastly you can execute Conv2d.py which will create a Bidimension Convolutional Neural Network model to start classifying the images.

You should execute all files in the same folder in order to obtain the correct performance.
